Description: BHAM is a freely avaible R pakcage that implments Bayesian
  hierarchical additive models for high-dimensional clinical and genomic data.
  The package includes functions that generlized additive model, and Cox additive
  model with the spike-and-slab LASSO prior. These functions implements scalable
  and stable algorithms to estimate parameters. BHAM also provides utility
  functions to construct additive models in high dimensional settings, 
  select optimal models, summarize bi-level variable selection results, 
  and visualize nonlinear effects. The package can facilitate flexible 
  modeling of large-scale molecular data, i.e. detecting succeptable 
  variables and inforing disease diagnostic and prognostic.
